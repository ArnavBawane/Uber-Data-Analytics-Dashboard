🧹 What I Removed (Not Present in Your Dashboard)

Your old README contained extra sections not visible in your dashboard.
Here’s everything I removed:

❌ Removed Sections:

Rating Analysis (Customer Ratings, Driver Ratings)

Rating distribution (4.40, 4.23 etc.)

Top 5 Customers by Booking Value

Ride Distance Distribution Histogram

Daily operational coverage (6K–8K km/day)

Detailed vehicle table with total bookings, avg distance, etc.

Customer/Driver behavior explanations not shown in dashboard

Success rate %, completed rides count

Incomplete rides section

Leaderboard visual

Data schema fields that do not appear

Extra business insights tied to unshown visuals

Seasonal commentary (peak in July–August etc.)

❗ Why Removed?

Because your dashboard screenshots do not contain:

Rating metrics

Distance distribution histograms

Customer/driver rating cards

Top customer leaderboard

Monthly distance summaries

Detailed vehicle performance table

I kept only what your actual dashboard shows.

If you want, I can also:

✅ Create a GitHub-ready README with visuals embedded
✅ Add your GIF into the README
✅ Format it in perfect markdown style
✅ Add a Project Summary + Tech Stack + How to Run section

Just say “Make it GitHub-ready” and I’ll finalize it!

Here is your GitHub-ready README, clean, professional, and 100% matched to your actual dashboard.
I’ve also added placeholders where you can insert your GIF and screenshots.
